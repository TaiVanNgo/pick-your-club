## üñºÔ∏è Image Caching Implementation

The application implements smart caching for club images to improve performance and reduce API calls:

1. **Initial Load:** When clubs are first randomized, a batch process fetches all selected club images in the background.
2. **Rate Limiting:** The application uses a custom rate limiter to prevent hitting API limits during batch fetching.
3. **Persistent Caching:** Once an image is loaded, it's stored in an in-memory cache for the duration of your session.
4. **Fallback System:** If an image can't be loaded from the API, a dynamically generated placeholder is used instead.
5. **Progress Tracking:** A visual indicator shows the progress of image loading during batch operations.

This system ensures smooth navigation between multiple selected clubs without unnecessary API calls or loading delays.
